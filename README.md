# spotify-to-offline-mp3

# Abstract
An application that can get the list of a user's liked songs and then using webscraping on Youtube it can download those songs and save them on the user's computer.
I made this to explore Python Flask framework and also because I needed this service so to say because of Spotify's newest update which imposes severe restrictions for free users of the app, so I thought why not download all the songs and listen to them offline without buying Premium, and it felt like a fun projet so here we are.

# Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
